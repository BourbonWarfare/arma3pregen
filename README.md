Only numbers and the `*` prefix/suffix is allowed.

### Local mod IDs
Items starting with `@` are added to the preset as local mods.  
Only alphanumeric characters and `_` is allowed.

### Optional mods
Append or prepend a `*` to mark an ID optional.

### DLC / CDLC mods
Items starting with `!` are added to the preset as DLC mods.

### Preset name prefix
Append a custom preset name / file name prefix to the url after `?` and before `#`.
